# D3-Map-Pie-chart

Data Visualization using D3.js .Created two responsive and interactive assets using HTML,CSS, JavaScript and D3.js

Part 1: Map
Created a map of the United States of America using data-states.csv. Each state should be shaded or colored according to the "Percent of Population" column.

Additionally, when a user hovers states, a tooltip is appeared displaying information from the columns "State", "Percent of Population", "Median Household Income" and "Percent of Income"

Part 2: Pie Charts
Created two side-by-side pie charts using data-gender-age.csv. Each chart represents the two age groups found in the "Age" column. Each pie chart division is  based on the "Preparedness" column while the value for each division is the "Percent Value" column.

Included two buttons, labeled "Women" and "Men", above the interactive that toggle the displayed gender data with "Women" set as the default dataset.
